abstract: The increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, especially in hospitals where quick and effective treatment is essential. This paper presents the development, implementation, and technical evaluation of appATB®, an interoperable mHealth platform designed to support antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals. appATB® integrates real-time local clinical and microbiological data to provide clinicians with real-time access to local microbiological data and, Antibiotic Stewardship Programs (ASP) teams with information on prescribed empirical treatments. The platform was co-designed with clinicians, developed using agile methodologies and deployed and integrated with information systems of three Spanish hospitals. Key technical aspects such as interoperability with existing hospital systems, data accuracy, and system scalability were prioritized. Evaluation of appATB® followed the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 standards, demonstrating its functional suitability, performance efficiency, and reliability. appATB®'s architecture, featuring a progressive web application interface, supports adaptability, maintainability, and scalability, making it a robust tool for enhancing ASP.
